# zahnarzt-schopplich.de

Micro website for my father's dental office.

Also a playground for me to try different static site generators. This project was once built with Vite SSG, but has migrated to [√Æles].

[√Æles]: https://github.com/ElMassimo/iles

It serves as a best practice solution for when I want to spin up a SSG site quickly.
